## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a robust and efficient system for detecting and classifying plant diseases using image processing and machine learning techniques. This system aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early detection and management of plant diseases, ultimately contributing to improved crop health and yield.

## Overview
This Plant Disease Detection System leverages computer vision and deep learning to accurately identify various plant diseases from images of plant leaves. By using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, the system can classify images into different disease categories and provide actionable insights for disease management.

## Features
- **Image Classification:** Classifies images of plant leaves into different disease categories.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading images and viewing results.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Offers real-time disease detection and classification.
- **Scalability:** Can be scaled to include more plant species and disease types.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Data Collection
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of images of plant leaves affected by various diseases. The data collection process involved:
1. **Source:** Images were sourced from publicly available datasets, agricultural research institutions, and field surveys.
2. **Diversity:** Ensuring a diverse set of images representing different plant species and disease conditions.
3. **Annotation:** Each image was annotated with the corresponding disease label by agricultural experts.

## Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for model training, the following preprocessing steps were applied:
1. **Image Resizing:** All images were resized to a uniform size to ensure consistency.
2. **Normalization:** Pixel values were normalized to a range of [0, 1] to facilitate model training.
3. **Augmentation:** Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming were applied to increase the diversity of the training dataset and prevent overfitting.
4. **Splitting:** The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Model Architecture
The system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. The model architecture includes:
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features from input images.
- **Pooling Layers:** Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Perform classification based on the extracted features.
- **Activation Functions:** Introduce non-linearity into the model.

## Training and Evaluation
The model was trained using the training dataset and evaluated on the validation and test sets. Key steps include:
- **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy loss was used for training.
- **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer was employed to minimize the loss function.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs were tuned to achieve optimal performance.
